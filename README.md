Here is the thing. You can not develop code without data and you can not
explore your data without code.

Effective interdisciplinary cooperation in data science projects
requires smooth access to both data and code. In the meanwhile our
project team members enthusiastically keep turning every stone and thus
create thousands of files in a few months time…

However, in our world of heritage science we lack basic infrastructure
to easily share data files that can be explored and used directly in
Jupyter notebooks. Recently our lab has installed a Nextcloud server
that gives our team the possibility to share project folders with data
files. These can be accessed manually via a web interface, but also
programmatically with the webdav protocol.

With `fairdatanow` we want to learn how to smoothly share dynamic data
directly in Jupyter notebooks…
