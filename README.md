Effective interdisciplinary cooperation in data science projects
requires smooth access to both code and data. However, in our world of
heritage science we lack basic infrastructure to easily share data files
that can be explored and used directly in Jupyter notebooks. Recently
our lab has installed a Nextcloud server that gives our team the
possibility to share project folders with data files. These can be
accessed manually via a web interface, but also programmatically with
the webdav protocol.

With `fairdatanow` we want to learn how to smoothly share dynamic data
directly in Jupyter notebooksâ€¦
