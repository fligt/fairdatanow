# Welcome to webdavnext

Interdisciplinary cooperation in data science projects requires smooth
access to both code and data. However, in our world of heritage science
we lack basic infrastructure to easily share data files that can be
explored and used directly in Jupyter notebooks. Recently our lab has
installed a Nextcloud server that gives our team the possibility to
share project folders with data files. These can be accessed manually
via a web interface, but also programmatically with the webdav protocol.

With `webdavnext` we want to learn how to smoothly share dynamic data
directly in Jupyter notebooks via the webdav protocolâ€¦
